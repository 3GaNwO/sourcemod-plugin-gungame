Changelog
---------
        * Fixed bug:
            Bug report: When multikill is enabled, and pnifepro is enabled
            then kills per level does not reset for player if he is killed with 
            knife when he is on the first level.
        * Updated german translation.

    1.0.5.19:
        * All panel texts moved to translation files.
        
    1.0.5.18:
        * Fixed: 
            Bug report: I'm not sure if this has already been mentioned, but it seems name changes 
            don't apply to !top10. So your gungame rank would always be stored with the name you 
            used on the first game you won.    

    1.0.5.17:
        * Fixed:
            Bug report: Triple bonus sound keeps playing on death/respawn
        + Added team change check and do not level down if player changed team.
        * Some minor improvments:
            Cpu usage reduced if kills per level is 1.
            If kills per level is 1 than trigger event knife_steal on knife level.

    1.0.5.16:
        * Fixed:
            Bug report: after win, winner levels up and gets a level greater than max level defined 
            in equip file (there is an info about it in chat). I think that you should block 
            leveling after win.
        + Added native: GG_GetLevelWeaponName.

    1.0.5.15:
        * Improvement: 
            In warmup when you have "ResetLevelAfterWarmup" "1" and you don't level up, there 
            is an info in chat "[GunGame] Player has lost a level by suicided" or any other 
            about losing a level (i.e. tk). I think it's unnecessary since you can't gain 
            or loss any level in this warmup mode.
        + Added config variable to enabled/disable god mode on 
            triple level - "TripleLevelBonusGodMode".
        + Added gravity boost to the player on bonus.
            
    1.0.5.14:
        + Added global forward with triple level event.
        + Added "gg_triple_level" log event.
        + Added "gg_last_level" log event.
        * Fixed:
            Bug report: I noticed this on respawn servers, the FF is not enabled directly when a player reach nade 
            level, but only if he dies and respawns. (So if he doesnt die, the game can end without 
            ff being enabled.
        * Fixed:
            L 12/26/2009 - 20:41:35: [SM] Plugin encountered error 25: Call was aborted
            L 12/26/2009 - 20:41:35: [SM] Native "ThrowError" reported: Client 3 is not in game

    1.0.5.13:
        * Fixed:
            Bug report: Well i'm running a respawn/turbo server and it seems ff stays turned on even 
            if player is no longer on nade level. I'm running some tests and it seems the ff warning 
            is displayed when a player does reach nade even if another player is already on nade level 
            sometimes.
        * Fixed:
            Bug report: when somebody reaches knife level then you don't hear nade level sound (but this 
            is ok, isn't it?); however, when somebody else reaches knife level then you don't hear next 
            knife level sound and I think it's bad because this is usually last level and everybody 
            should now that next knifer is among them
        * Fixed:
            Bug report: after nade kill you get knife instantly, on next spawn knife is not your default 
            weapon and you have to switch to it manually; it would be nice to have it on spawn as 
            primary weapon ;)
            
    1.0.5.12:
        * Fixed: server crash when removing C4 (with remove map objectives enabled).
        * Fixed: When you steal level with knife you don't hear steal sound but level up sound.
    
    1.0.5.11:
        * Fixed: Players should not level down for suicide after round end.
        * Improvement: weapon removement improved.
        * Fixed bug: When a player reach triple level, the triple level sound (default 
            one) stop playing after 1 sec.

    1.0.5.10:
        * Fixed: recalculate leader if restored level is greater than leader level.
        
    1.0.5.9:
        * Fix for 1.0.5.8: gungame does not work at all. I forgot to remove very last hack.

    1.0.5.8:
        - Removed unused hacks.

    1.0.5.7:
        * Fixed bug:
            Miltilevel with knife does not work if knifepro enabled.
    
        * Improvement:
            I'm getting info in chat during warmup "[GunGame] You are on level 1 :: glock". 
            I think that player level info shouldn't appear when I have "ResetLevelAfterWarmup" "1".

    1.0.5.6:
        + Added russian translation.
        + Added german translation. Thanks to tObIwAnKeNoBi.
        * Fixed bug:
            Players do not triple level. Fast speed, sound etc - when they get 3 levels.
        * Fixed bug:
            when I have "WarmupStartup" "1" and each team has a player then new round starts with info 
            in chat "[GunGame] Warmup round has not started yet" when should be "[GunGame] Warmup round 
            is in progress". It is ok in next round.
        * Fixed bug:
            plugin require one extra AFK death than set in config file i.e. 
            "AfkDeaths" "2" - requires 3 AFK deaths before an action
        * Fixed bug:
            AFK deaths counter is not cleared after AFK kick (maybe also when it 
            moves to spectators). When you got AFK kick, rejoin and get one more AFK 
            death then plugin kicks instantly no matter what is in "AfkDeaths".
        * Fixed bug:
            AFK action moving to spectators don't work

    1.0.5.5:
        * Fixed bug: With knifepro enabled and the attacker on knife level, they do not steal 
            levels from other players when they knife someone.
    
    1.0.5.4:
        * Fixed bug: 
            There is one little bug. I'm using Turbo mode on my server and when I kill somebody 
            with awp then next weapon is a nade. So, I should get glock, flashbang, smokenade 
            and hegrenade (i set it on config). But I'm getting only glock and nade. I have it 
            all on next spawn but not in the same round I gained new level  . This happens every 
            time to me when I get nade level before round end.

    1.0.5.3:
        * Fixed bug: If WorldspawnSuicide is 0 than player could level up with worldspawn.

        * Refactoring: Restore level on reconnect was moved from handicap and now is independent.
          Added new config variable to enable/disable this function - RestoreLevelOnReconnect.

    1.0.5.2:
        * Fixed:
            [SM] Native "IsPlayerAlive" reported: Client 10 is not in game
            L 12/22/2009 - 15:27:41: [SM] Displaying call stack trace for plugin "gungame.smx": L 12/22/2009 - 15:27:41: [SM]
            [0]  Line 290, E:\Download \sm_gungame-1.0.5.1\addons\sourcemod\scripting\gungame.sp::OnClientDisconnect()
            
    1.0.5.1:
        * Strip weapons from dead players completely rewritten.
          Cpu usage optimization.

        * Weapon to index procedure rewritten from keyvalue to trie array. 
          Cpu usage optimization.
    
    1.0.5.0:
        + Providing "AfkAction" = 0 in gungame.config.txt will disables kicking/moving
            to specs afk players without disabling afk management completely.
        + Added config variable to allow level up after round end - "AllowLevelUpAfterRoundEnd".
        + Added config variable to strip dead players weapons so that their weapons can't 
            be picked up - "StripDeadPlayersWeapon".
        + Timer moved to hint box instead of screen center.
        + Added ticking sound for the last 5 warmup seconds.
        + Added global forward GG_OnWarmupEnd which fire when GG warmup is over.
        * All "play" sounds replaced with EmitSound.
        * All chat texts are moved to translation files.

    1.0.4.1:
        * Fixed bug:
            - its seems like there is a bug in the latest release with the two new cvars. I 
            have the RemoveWeaponAmmo set to 0 and it works for one round and not the next 
            round I have nade set to 2 kills required. 
        + Added handicap mode 3. It's like handicap mode 2 but skipping bots.
            Usefull for dm servers with bots blocking round end.
            
    1.0.4.0:
        * Fixed bug:
            I dont level down at all, when i kill my self with a nade.
            (autofriendlyfire is 1 i think)
        * Fixed bug: 
            When i kill a teammate, kill a enemy and then another enemy with the knife 
            i triple level. But not always. Yet I couldn't figure it out why.
            (maxlevelperround is 2 i think)
        + Added configuration variable for disable RemoveWeaponAmmo of NadeBonus weapon.
        + Added option to reload ammo on player kill.
        + Enabled removing all weapons before giving next level 
            weapon for player if Turbo is enabled.
        
    1.0.3.0:
        + Restore level on player reconnect.
      
    1.0.2.0:
        + There are forwards for logging level up and level down.
          Added logging for lvlup, lvldn, lvlsteal to gungame_logging.sp
        * Fixed:
            L 09/16/2009 - 13:26:45: [SM] Native "GetClientAuthString" reported: Client index 0 is invalid
            L 09/16/2009 - 13:26:45: [SM] Displaying call stack trace for plugin "gungame_logging.smx":

        * Bugfix for:
            L 10/07/2009 - 00:27:23: [SM] Native "GetClientTeam" reported: Client 1 is not in game
            L 10/07/2009 - 00:27:23: [SM] Displaying call stack trace for plugin "gungame_logging.smx":

            L 10/07/2009 - 00:27:23: [SM]   [1]  Line 64, gungame_logging.sp::GG_OnLeaderChange()
        + Added gg_leader and gg_knife_level events to logger.
          gg_leader event triggered when leader changed.
          gg_knife_level event triggered when player reaches last level.
        * Changed GG_OnClientLevelChange forward prototype. Added "last level"
          param.
        * Bugfix: 
            One BIG bug, which, I think, wasn't mentioned here: gungame 1.0.1.1 
            removes buysites. When it's disabled, it also removes.

    1.0.1.1:
        * Renamed cvar from sm_gungame_css_version to sm_gungamesm_version.
        * Blue color is unreadable. Changed to light blue.
        * Disabled money removement. Removed buyzones instead.
        * Fixed issue: map does not change after gungame winner.
          Update your gungame.games.txt only if you've updated
          your steam engine to the latest version and map
          does not change after somebody win.
        * Fixed warmup end right after round_restart (warmup was 
          ending 1 second before round_restart).
        - Removed CSSDM patch.
        + Added elimination mode. Elimination mode added to ggdm plugin.
          For elimination mode you will need sm_ggdm 1.5.1+
          http://forums.alliedmods.net/showpost.php?p=927227&postcount=27
          You should not update gungame plugin for that, only ggdm.
        * Bug fixed:
            L 07/30/2009 - 06:55:41: [SM] Native "GetClientTeam" reported: Client index 0 is invalid

        * Fixed top10 scoreboard.
            !top10 was not working corretly, when someone reaches someone's else place.
            For example player1 is on 8 place with 255 wins, player2 is on place 9
            with 254 wins. Than player 2 wins 2 times, and even so he has 255 wins 
            on top10 list. But in winners he has 256 wins.
        
    1.0.0.1.12:
        * Fixed if VoteLevelLessWeaponCount = 0 then player can not win from the first time.
        * Fixed to change player's level down when self killed with grenade if autofriendlyfire is disabled.
        * Fixed Handicap.
        * Fixed intermission to start right after player has won (no round start if team has won).
        + Added examples to gungame.mapconfig.cfg.
        - Removed mp_chattime modification.
        
    1.0.0.1.11:
        * Fixed top10 update on gungame win (it was not working if players have same wins).
        * Fixed not to give additional grenade if player kills with grenade with ExtraNade on.
    
    1.0.0.1.10:
        + Added motd winner display.
        + Added option to winner display for the custom URL.

        * Extended plugin info: added new author and new url.
        + Added external converter for winners db file from es gg5 to gg3.
        + Added option to disable annoying chat messages if multikill enabled.

    1.0.0.1.8:

        * Fixed top left winner message size for long nicknames.
        + Added handycap option to give the lowest level to new connected player.
        
    1.0.0.1.5:
        * Fixed money remove on player kill.
        * Colorized winner message.
        + Added sounds on last/nade level.

    1.0.0.1.3:
        * Added exit button "1" to "!score" menu
        * Code improved. Separated business logic about calculating leader from
          showing messages to chat. Added UTIL_RecalculateLeader and it is called from 
          UTIL_ChangeLevel. Added PrintLeaderToChat. 
        * Fixed recalculating leader on TK (GG_RemoveALevel)
        * Fixed saving to top10.txt. The issue was that only 9 players was in !top10. 10-th player
          was never loaded, so on map end his rank was rewritten by the winner.
        * Fixed warmup end right after round_restart (warmup was ending 1 second before round_restart).
        
    1.0.0.1.2:
        * Fixed bug with no message about tied with the leader when leader on level 2 (first level gained)
          Fixed FindLeader to return CLIENT (it was returning LEVEL not CLIENT). (!!!)
        * Fixed bug with no message about leaders if stealing level
        * ChangeLevel and FindLeader should come together, because
          each ChangeLevel can change and the CurrentLeader.
        * Fixed CurrentLeader calculation on stealing level
        * Fixed behaviour if multiple leaders found on intermission
    
    1.0.0.1.1:
        * Version changed :)
        * Write leaders to chat, not in hint box
        * Disable second line on spawn to chat if custom kill per level = 1 (annoying line)
        - Disable "congratulation" line (there is a sound)
        + Added line "is leading on level X" after leader gained next level
        * Fixed possible bug for random winner sound
        * Redesigned all menus where it is possible to change "0. Exit" to "1. Exit".
          It's pretty much ergonomic button.
        * Fixed gg_rebuild to recreate top10panel. Now you do not need to wait for map end
          to see recreated top10 panel.
        * Fixed HasRank value after SaveRank. Now you do not need to restart plugin 
          if there was no winners yet.
        * Redesigned "!level" panel.
    
    1.0.0.1 unofficial release 2:
        * Fixed gg_import
        * Redesigned join message panel

        * Fixed JoinMessage config variable
        * Commented hookusermessage due to bug (server crash on plugin unload)
