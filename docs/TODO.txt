    * Feature requests: I have few suggestions:
        * It would be nice to have information about leader weapon in chat message 
            "[GunGame] Player is leading on level 10", like "[GunGame] Player is leading 
            on level 10 :: xm1014"
        * Add info about player's weapon in !scores and !level panels. It's hard to remember 
            what weapon is on which level, so it might be a good idea to add such info 
            together with level number. Now you have to know it first or check with !weapons 
            command.
        * Browsable winners list would be a nice feature. You can replace !top10 with !top 
            and make it browsable.
        * New !leader command, which should show current leader(s) level, weapon and list 
            of players on leader level in a panel.
    * Feature request:
        Add visual effects to the player on bonus like blink golden effect and sparks.
    + Feature request:
        I also have an idea about round start message like "You are on level 1 :: glock". What do you 
        think about moving it to the hint box (like warmup timer) and add information about leader 
        level like "Leader level 24 :: awp"?
    + Feature request:
        - configurable warmup weapon by cvar

        For example I've wrote very simple plugin which randomize warmup weapon in ES GG5 
        (by changing gg_warmup_weapon value). You should add such cvar as well, it's useful. 
        
        If enabled weapon reloading on kill then reload warmup weapon.
    * Think about this feature request:
        I also would like to request that plugin could save level kills when level down. 
        For example when there are 3 kill levels and you have already killed 2 and somebody 
        knifes you. Instead of starting from 0 kills on previous level you could continue 
        from 2 kill. Many people on my server are constantly complaining one this issue.

        Example:
        was - level 4, points 2 (miltikill 4)
        after knifed - level 3, point 1 (multikill 2)
        levelNew = levelOld - 1, 
        pointsNew = floor((poinsOld/miltikillOld) * multikillNew)
    + Feature request:
        Is it possible to enable friendly fire earlier than on nade level
    + Feature request:
        If you kill yourself or a teammate you loose one level. I want set this 
        to loose 2 levels, or 3, or...
    + Implement gg_handicap_update like in esgg5.
    * Is there a way to put more nades on he level, like this one 
      for GunGame5? http://forums.gungame5.com/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=265        
    * Feature request:
        1) I want to run a random weapon order but *always* have knife 
        and nade as the last two weapons. When I turn random weapon order 
        on it mixes knife and nade into the mix. Is there a way to make 
        knife and nade the last two weapons?
        Add something like configurable random weapons groups.
    * Make removement buyzones on/off. So once gg is enabled than buyzones are
      disabled, and when gg is disabled buyzones are enabled.
      Maybe instead of removement buyzones just disable it to players on
      spawn and when gg swithces enabled/disabled.
    + Add winners menu:
        Also could you incorporate the attached code into your next release?
        The menu idea is from GG5's Winner Menu 
        (http://addons.eventscripts.com/addons/view/gg_winner_menu)
        https://forums.alliedmods.net/showpost.php?p=949442&postcount=255
    + Review code and include it in plugin (advanced stats):
        Hey altex, I've requested few stats features: !leader and !top command once. I've 
        already done it myself. I'm using here playersdata.txt file. Maybe you want to add 
        these commands to your plugin? Feel free to do that  .

    + Implement !buylevel.
    * [UNAPPROVED] Sometimes "!scores" shows wrong levels if it was many knife battles.
      I can not figure out algorythm to reproduce this bug. Maybe all is ok.
    * [UNAPPROVED] Bug report:
        2) I also like to require 2 kills per round. This works fine 
        but with Knife Pro turned on, it still takes two knife kills to 
        level up where it should only take one knife kill. Is there an 
        option for this?
    * [UNAPPROVED] Bug report:
        I found two bugs.
        - First, if the player has hegrenade, he's the last man standing in his team and 
          he suicides, he doesn't loose his level.
        - Second (maybe it's some problem w/ server), quite often when somebody makes a 
          knivekill, server just shuts down and i have to restart it.
        On the 1.0.0.1.12v the 2nd problem hasn't appeared, so I'm downgrading.
    * Bug report:
        [UNAPPROVED] I dont think that de Handicap works as it should :/
        On my server i set it to "1" that means it should give the AVG level, but.
        If a players joins the server he/she always got the first weapon no matter
        what the AVG level is., but after he recconnect he get's the AVG level.
        So in shot newly connected players aren't getting the avg level.
    * Fix:

      Comment: Realy dont understand how it is possible. Is it knife throw plugin installed?
      Think about what to do if Killer == 0.
      I dont know how it is possible.

    * These function arent working:
        - [UNAPPROVED] Handicap (givin neewly connected player teh avg level)
            So people are playing on server let's say there are 6 players 
            and all of them are on the same level ( just to keep simple 
            the explain), let say level 10.
            A 7th player joins the game.
            He should start at level 10 after joining T or CT ,
            BUT!!!! he starts at level 1 instead.
            He wil only get the avg. level by using the "retry" 
            reconnect consoloe command. After reconnectig the plugin 
            works fine and the player get's the avg. level.

            So to keep it simple, neewly connected players don't get 
            the avg or min level, only after recconecting.
    * When bot just added than it is assigning to team and spawning 
      before it "entered the game". So he did not receive knife
      and then gungame plugin add him knife. But then he disconnects
      and respawning (after entren the game) but there is dropped
      knife.
    * Another great way to remove weapons on player death:
        new ent = -1
        if ((ent = FindEntityByClassname(ent, "game_weapon_manager")) > -1)
        {
            SetVariantString("maxpieces 0");
            AcceptEntityInput(ent, "AddOutput");
        }      
    * Feature request: It would be nice if the chat triggers where hidden 
        from chat. (!level, !rules, etc)
