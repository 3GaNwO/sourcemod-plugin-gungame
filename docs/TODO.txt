    * Fix: Hi. I store my winners info in remote MySQL database and after 
        midnight it response really slow sometimes. So, after win I don't 
        get winner motd and place in stats immediately. I'm getting it on 
        the next map, which is kinda weird for players. Could you cancel 
        displaying winner's infos if this happens on the next map? Thanx
    * Bug report:
        L 02/19/2010 - 00:25:54: [SM] Native "GG_GetPlayerPlaceInStat" reported: Client is not currently ingame [15]
        L 02/19/2010 - 00:25:54: [SM] Displaying call stack trace for plugin "gungame_display_winner.smx":

    + Feature: Add ability to enable friendly fire earlier than on nade level
    + Feature: Add ability to disable rtv if leader is above X level.
    
    ----====----==== Normal priority list ----====----====

    + Feature: Do you think handicap should be given on first spawn, not on 
        connect? As an admin I might spec for the first 2 minutes of a map 
        but never join the game. If I reconnect I can get the handicap. 
        But it might as well give it to me the first time I join into play, 
        since other players connecting would be given the handicap. 
    + Feature: change "Top10Handicap" to make possibility to choose other 
        Top range for excluding from handicap; "HandicapMaxRank" "25" for 
        example, might mean that only players with rank > 25 will get 
        handicap level.

    + Add winners menu:
        Also could you incorporate the attached code into your next release?
        The menu idea is from GG5's Winner Menu 
        (http://addons.eventscripts.com/addons/view/gg_winner_menu)
        https://forums.alliedmods.net/showpost.php?p=949442&postcount=255
        High severity because of much code to review and implement.
        
    ----====----==== Pending list ----====----====
    
    + Feature: Add visual effects to the player on bonus like blink golden effect and sparks.
        Notes: It is simple to implement, but i do not know what exectly effect will be 
        nice looking. env_spark is not usefull because it just does not spark for about 5
        seconds from 10 seconds when effect is enabled.
        Pending because of i do not know what exactly effect to use.
    + Feature: create some options for gungame_stats like display rank to 
        all or to player only, show winner in chat etc.
        Pending because of i do not know what exactly features is needed.
    * Waiting for ability to check sourcemod version in runtime and use function that
        is not present in the previous versions. For example GetURandomInt was added
        in sm 1.3.0. So it is needed to recompile this plugin for versions less then 1.3.0
        without this function.

    + Feature: Implement !buylevel.
    * Bug: When bot has just been added than it is assigning to team and spawning 
      before it "entered the game". So he did not receive knife
      and then gungame plugin add him knife. But then he disconnects
      and respawning (after entren the game) but there is dropped
      knife.
    * Bug: If KnifePro && KnifeProHE && ExtraNade are enabled then we give extra grenade 
      on knife kill and leveling up player, but it is a bug.
    * Improvement: Make removement buyzones on/off. So once gg is enabled than buyzones are
      disabled, and when gg is disabled buyzones are enabled.
      Maybe instead of removement buyzones just disable it to players on
      spawn and when gg swithces enabled/disabled.
    + Feature: Need features from es gg 5: Colorize knife-level player.
    + Feature: Need features from es gg 5: Random sounds?
