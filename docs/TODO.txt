    + Add !rank command to show player's current place in stats.
    * Feature request:
        Browsable winners list would be a nice feature. You can replace !top10 with !top 
        and make it browsable.
    * Feature request:
        Add visual effects to the player on bonus like blink golden effect and sparks.
    + Feature request:
        I also have an idea about round start message like "You are on level 1 :: glock". What do you 
        think about moving it to the hint box (like warmup timer) and add information about leader 
        level like "Leader level 24 :: awp"?
    + Feature request:
        - configurable warmup weapon by cvar

        For example I've wrote very simple plugin which randomize warmup weapon in ES GG5 
        (by changing gg_warmup_weapon value). You should add such cvar as well, it's useful. 
        
        If enabled weapon reloading on kill then reload warmup weapon.
    * Think about this feature request:
        I also would like to request that plugin could save level kills when level down. 
        For example when there are 3 kill levels and you have already killed 2 and somebody 
        knifes you. Instead of starting from 0 kills on previous level you could continue 
        from 2 kill. Many people on my server are constantly complaining one this issue.

        Example:
        was - level 4, points 2 (miltikill 4)
        after knifed - level 3, point 1 (multikill 2)
        levelNew = levelOld - 1, 
        pointsNew = floor((poinsOld/miltikillOld) * multikillNew)
    + Feature request:
        Is it possible to enable friendly fire earlier than on nade level
    + Feature request:
        If you kill yourself or a teammate you loose one level. I want set this 
        to loose 2 levels, or 3, or...
    + Implement gg_handicap_update like in esgg5.
    * Is there a way to put more nades on he level, like this one 
      for GunGame5? http://forums.gungame5.com/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=265        
    * Feature request:
        1) I want to run a random weapon order but *always* have knife 
        and nade as the last two weapons. When I turn random weapon order 
        on it mixes knife and nade into the mix. Is there a way to make 
        knife and nade the last two weapons?
        Add something like configurable random weapons groups.
    * Make removement buyzones on/off. So once gg is enabled than buyzones are
      disabled, and when gg is disabled buyzones are enabled.
      Maybe instead of removement buyzones just disable it to players on
      spawn and when gg swithces enabled/disabled.
    + Add winners menu:
        Also could you incorporate the attached code into your next release?
        The menu idea is from GG5's Winner Menu 
        (http://addons.eventscripts.com/addons/view/gg_winner_menu)
        https://forums.alliedmods.net/showpost.php?p=949442&postcount=255
    + Review code and include it in plugin (advanced stats):
        Hey altex, I've requested few stats features: !leader and !top command once. I've 
        already done it myself. I'm using here playersdata.txt file. Maybe you want to add 
        these commands to your plugin? Feel free to do that  .

    ----====----==== High severity list ----====----====
    
    * Enable hookusermessage after fix for https://bugs.alliedmods.net/show_bug.cgi?id=3817
    * Improve random number generation algorithm after fix for https://bugs.alliedmods.net/show_bug.cgi?id=3831

    + Implement !buylevel.
    * When bot just added than it is assigning to team and spawning 
      before it "entered the game". So he did not receive knife
      and then gungame plugin add him knife. But then he disconnects
      and respawning (after entren the game) but there is dropped
      knife.
    * Feature request:
        It would be nice to have information about leader weapon in chat message 
        "[GunGame] Player is leading on level 10", like "[GunGame] Player is leading 
        on level 10 :: xm1014"
