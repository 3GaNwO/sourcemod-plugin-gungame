    * [UNCONFIRMED] Bug: With KnifeProMinLevel "1" and ResetLevelAfterWarmup "1" 
        you can still gain a level in the warmup round if you knife 
        someone after the round has ended and before the next round 
        starts.
    * Think about this feature request:
        I also would like to request that plugin could save level kills when level down (and level up?). 
        For example when there are 3 kill levels and you have already killed 2 and somebody 
        knifes you. Instead of starting from 0 kills on previous level you could continue 
        from 2 kill. Many people on my server are constantly complaining one this issue.
        Example:
        was - level 4, points 2 (miltikill 4)
        after knifed - level 3, point 1 (multikill 2)
        levelNew = levelOld - 1, 
        pointsNew = floor((poinsOld/miltikillOld) * multikillNew)
    + Feature request:
        Is it possible to enable friendly fire earlier than on nade level
    + Implement gg_handicap_update like in esgg5.
    * Feature request:
        1) I want to run a random weapon order but *always* have knife 
        and nade as the last two weapons. When I turn random weapon order 
        on it mixes knife and nade into the mix. Is there a way to make 
        knife and nade the last two weapons?
        Add something like configurable random weapons groups.

    * Improve random number generation algorithm after fix for https://bugs.alliedmods.net/show_bug.cgi?id=3831
        High severity because of needed changes in sourcemod it-self.
    + Add winners menu:
        Also could you incorporate the attached code into your next release?
        The menu idea is from GG5's Winner Menu 
        (http://addons.eventscripts.com/addons/view/gg_winner_menu)
        https://forums.alliedmods.net/showpost.php?p=949442&postcount=255
        High severity because of much code to review and implement.
        
    ----====----==== Pending list ----====----====
    
    + Feature: Add visual effects to the player on bonus like blink golden effect and sparks.
        Notes: It is simple to implement, but i do not know what exectly effect will be 
        nice looking. env_spark is not usefull because it just does not spark for about 5
        seconds from 10 seconds when effect is enabled.
        Pending because of i do not know what exactly effect to use.
    + Feature: create some options for gungame_stats like display rank to 
        all or to player only, show winner in chat etc.
        Pending because of i do not know what exactly features is needed.
    + Feature: I also have an idea about round start message like "You are on level 1 :: glock". What do you 
        think about moving it to the hint box (like warmup timer) and add information about leader 
        level like "Leader level 24 :: awp"?
        Pending for ideas how to put all this texts with multikill chat message in one small hint box.
        I think it is very hard to do, and by the way it does not support colorize, so such 
        messages as multikill chat message can be hard to read without colorizing. And we can not
        leave this message in chat and all others in hintbox, because it looks junked.
    
    ----====----==== Low priority list ----====----====
    
    + Feature: Implement !buylevel.
    * Bug: When bot has just been added than it is assigning to team and spawning 
      before it "entered the game". So he did not receive knife
      and then gungame plugin add him knife. But then he disconnects
      and respawning (after entren the game) but there is dropped
      knife.
    * Bug: If KnifePro && KnifeProHE && ExtraNade are enabled then we give extra grenade 
      on knife kill and leveling up player, but it is a bug.
    * Improvement: Make removement buyzones on/off. So once gg is enabled than buyzones are
      disabled, and when gg is disabled buyzones are enabled.
      Maybe instead of removement buyzones just disable it to players on
      spawn and when gg swithces enabled/disabled.
    + Feature: Need features from es gg 5: Colorize knife-level player.
    + Feature: Need features from es gg 5: Random sounds?
