    + Implement gg_handicap_update like in esgg5.
    * Think about this feature request:
        I also would like to request that plugin could save level kills when level down (and level up?). 
        For example when there are 3 kill levels and you have already killed 2 and somebody 
        knifes you. Instead of starting from 0 kills on previous level you could continue 
        from 2 kill. Many people on my server are constantly complaining one this issue.
        Example:
        was - level 4, points 2 (miltikill 4)
        after knifed - level 3, point 1 (multikill 2)
        levelNew = levelOld - 1, 
        pointsNew = floor((poinsOld/miltikillOld) * multikillNew)
    + Feature: Add ability to enable friendly fire earlier than on nade level
    + Feature: Add ability to disable rtv if leader is above X level.

    * Improve random number generation algorithm after fix for https://bugs.alliedmods.net/show_bug.cgi?id=3831
        High severity because of needed changes in sourcemod it-self.
        It was fixed in sm version 1.3.0 by GerURandomInt() function.
        So add version check with "sourcemod_version" cvar.
    + Add winners menu:
        Also could you incorporate the attached code into your next release?
        The menu idea is from GG5's Winner Menu 
        (http://addons.eventscripts.com/addons/view/gg_winner_menu)
        https://forums.alliedmods.net/showpost.php?p=949442&postcount=255
        High severity because of much code to review and implement.
        
    ----====----==== Pending list ----====----====
    
    + Feature: Add visual effects to the player on bonus like blink golden effect and sparks.
        Notes: It is simple to implement, but i do not know what exectly effect will be 
        nice looking. env_spark is not usefull because it just does not spark for about 5
        seconds from 10 seconds when effect is enabled.
        Pending because of i do not know what exactly effect to use.
    + Feature: create some options for gungame_stats like display rank to 
        all or to player only, show winner in chat etc.
        Pending because of i do not know what exactly features is needed.
    
    ----====----==== Low priority list ----====----====
    
    + Feature: Implement !buylevel.
    * Bug: When bot has just been added than it is assigning to team and spawning 
      before it "entered the game". So he did not receive knife
      and then gungame plugin add him knife. But then he disconnects
      and respawning (after entren the game) but there is dropped
      knife.
    * Bug: If KnifePro && KnifeProHE && ExtraNade are enabled then we give extra grenade 
      on knife kill and leveling up player, but it is a bug.
    * Improvement: Make removement buyzones on/off. So once gg is enabled than buyzones are
      disabled, and when gg is disabled buyzones are enabled.
      Maybe instead of removement buyzones just disable it to players on
      spawn and when gg swithces enabled/disabled.
    + Feature: Need features from es gg 5: Colorize knife-level player.
    + Feature: Need features from es gg 5: Random sounds?
