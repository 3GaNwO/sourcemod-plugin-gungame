    * Feature request: 
        Need features from es gg 5:
        * Add bonuses (flash, smoke) on knife level.
        * Colorize knife-level player.
        * Random sounds?
    * Feature request:
        Add visual effects to the player on bonus like blink golden effect and sparks.
        Notes: It is simple to implement, but i do not know what exectly effect will be 
        nice looking. env_spark is not usefull because it just does not spark for about 5
        seconds from 10 seconds when effect is enabled.
    + Feature request:
        I also have an idea about round start message like "You are on level 1 :: glock". What do you 
        think about moving it to the hint box (like warmup timer) and add information about leader 
        level like "Leader level 24 :: awp"?
    * Think about this feature request:
        I also would like to request that plugin could save level kills when level down. 
        For example when there are 3 kill levels and you have already killed 2 and somebody 
        knifes you. Instead of starting from 0 kills on previous level you could continue 
        from 2 kill. Many people on my server are constantly complaining one this issue.

        Example:
        was - level 4, points 2 (miltikill 4)
        after knifed - level 3, point 1 (multikill 2)
        levelNew = levelOld - 1, 
        pointsNew = floor((poinsOld/miltikillOld) * multikillNew)
    + Feature request:
        Is it possible to enable friendly fire earlier than on nade level
    + Feature request:
        If you kill yourself or a teammate you loose one level. I want set this 
        to loose 2 levels, or 3, or...
    + Implement gg_handicap_update like in esgg5.
    * Is there a way to put more nades on he level, like this one 
      for GunGame5? http://forums.gungame5.com/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=265        
    * Feature request:
        1) I want to run a random weapon order but *always* have knife 
        and nade as the last two weapons. When I turn random weapon order 
        on it mixes knife and nade into the mix. Is there a way to make 
        knife and nade the last two weapons?
        Add something like configurable random weapons groups.
    + Add winners menu:
        Also could you incorporate the attached code into your next release?
        The menu idea is from GG5's Winner Menu 
        (http://addons.eventscripts.com/addons/view/gg_winner_menu)

    * Think about new features:
        I have few ideas, maybe you will fins some of them useful:
        * split gungame.config.txt to few parts; each optional plugin should have own 
            config file like gungame.config.txt , gungame.config.afk.txt, 
            gungame.config.stats.txt, gungame.config.sounds.txt etc.; I think it 
            will be easier to configure plugin for new users and adding (maybe in 
            the future) more option to optional plugins won't affect main config or 
            or other optional plugins configs
        * move sm_gungame_display_winner_url to config file instead of creating convar
        * merge gungame_display_winner with gungame_stats (since it requires gungame_stats 
            and there is not too much code)
        * create some options for gungame_stats like showing MOTD panel, display rank to 
            all or to player only, show winner in chat, show player rank on win in chat etc.
        
    ----====----==== High severity list ----====----====
    
    * Enable hookusermessage after fix for https://bugs.alliedmods.net/show_bug.cgi?id=3817
    * Improve random number generation algorithm after fix for https://bugs.alliedmods.net/show_bug.cgi?id=3831
    
    ----====----==== Low priority list ----====----====
    
    + Implement !buylevel.
    * When bot has just been added than it is assigning to team and spawning 
      before it "entered the game". So he did not receive knife
      and then gungame plugin add him knife. But then he disconnects
      and respawning (after entren the game) but there is dropped
      knife.
    * Feature request:
        It would be nice to have information about leader weapon in chat message 
        "[GunGame] Player is leading on level 10", like "[GunGame] Player is leading 
        on level 10 :: xm1014"
    * Make removement buyzones on/off. So once gg is enabled than buyzones are
      disabled, and when gg is disabled buyzones are enabled.
      Maybe instead of removement buyzones just disable it to players on
      spawn and when gg swithces enabled/disabled.
    * If KnifePro && KnifeProHE && ExtraNade are enabled then we give extra grenade 
      on knife kill and leveling up player, but it is a bug.
