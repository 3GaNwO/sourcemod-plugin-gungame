    * Bug report:
        во еще глюк заметил !score

    + Feature request:
        Is there an option to display how many kills a person has on each level? Where when you spawn or kill someone it would say:

        You are on level 1 :: Glock 1/4 kills
        You are on level 1 :: Glock 2/4 kills

        etc for each level?

		i try to load them together is there an ideas?

		MM 1.8.2

		GG 1.0.9.1 w/new file fix
		CSSDM Latest with the patch.. cant get them to work together
    + Feature: I would like to ask if there is an update of your plugin to come. 
        It would be cool, if some things could be added or improved. I could 
        think about some little aspects like
        - enable a 1 second respawn 
        - announcing nextmap on gg_win event
        - synchronising mp_chattime with the length of the individual map end sound
        - by updating gungame even the !give plugin could be worked over. Its now 
            a bit buggy, but the author told me hes also waiting for a gungame 
            update to fix his plugin (for example during knife warmup its possible 
            now to get the first weapon already by typing !give)
        - maybe its possible to implement a very simple achievement system (for 
            example "Owner of the Day with x.xxx Kills" or "Killing Machine with 
            xxx Kills") which is set to zero every day, so you dont need a big database.
    + Feature: Could you please add option, which will prevent winning game 
        by killing a bot? I have bots only to keep players on the server 
        before more of them will come. So, I don't want situation when 1 
        player pwning bots all the time and have "fake" wins. 
    + Feature: I have one more question. Is it possible to have few equip files (for 
        classic mode, reversed, random etc.) and change them by my own plugin?
        And what about changing GG cvar by plugin (some native for example)?
    * Bug report: Problem is that on nade level I get sometimes 2 flash nades. 
        I throw one and suddenly get another from nowhere. I'm not sure how to 
        reproduce it yet.
    * Bug report: Second bug I remember. When you do multikill (for example kill 
        two enemies with single AWP shot) you level up twice. I think this is a 
        bug because you level up with wrong weapon.

    + Add winners menu:
        Also could you incorporate the attached code into your next release?
        The menu idea is from GG5's Winner Menu 
        (http://addons.eventscripts.com/addons/view/gg_winner_menu)
        https://forums.alliedmods.net/showpost.php?p=949442&postcount=255
        High severity because of much code to review and implement.
        
    ----====----==== Pending list ----====----====
    
    + Feature: Add visual effects to the player on bonus like blink golden effect and sparks.
        Notes: It is simple to implement, but i do not know what exectly effect will be 
        nice looking. env_spark is not usefull because it just does not spark for about 5
        seconds from 10 seconds when effect is enabled.
        Pending because of i do not know what exactly effect to use.
    + Feature: create some options for gungame_stats like display rank to 
        all or to player only, show winner in chat etc.
        Pending because of i do not know what exactly features is needed.
    * Waiting for ability to check sourcemod version in runtime and use function that
        is not present in the previous versions. For example GetURandomInt was added
        in sm 1.3.0. So it is needed to recompile this plugin for versions less then 1.3.0
        without this function.

    + Feature: Implement !buylevel.
    * Bug: When bot has just been added than it is assigning to team and spawning 
      before it "entered the game". So he did not receive knife
      and then gungame plugin add him knife. But then he disconnects
      and respawning (after entren the game) but there is dropped
      knife.
    * Bug: If KnifePro && KnifeProHE && ExtraNade are enabled then we give extra grenade 
      on knife kill and leveling up player, but it is a bug.
    * Improvement: Make removement buyzones on/off. So once gg is enabled than buyzones are
      disabled, and when gg is disabled buyzones are enabled.
      Maybe instead of removement buyzones just disable it to players on
      spawn and when gg swithces enabled/disabled.
    + Feature: Need features from es gg 5: Colorize knife-level player.
    + Feature: Need features from es gg 5: Random sounds?
