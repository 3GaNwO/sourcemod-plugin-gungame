    * Is there a way to get the old effect back?

    + Feature request:

        Make it possible to disable or enable Turbo on the fly. gg_turbo 0...
        Make it possible to change triple level amount on the fly. gg_multilvl_amount 6
        Make it possible to change Weapon order on the fly. IE gg_weaponorder 1 or gg_weaponorder 2...

        If those are possible man That would be awsome..

        Also is it possible to give 2 flashes with knife level? 

    + Feature request:
        Altex, could you please add disabling winner announce in left upper corner in the next release? 

    + Feature request:
        Altex, do you think it's possible to add a feature to start the map 
        vote once someone has won the game?
        I'd like to have the mapvote after the game has been won instead of 
        when someone reaches "x" level. 
    * Bug report:
        во еще глюк заметил !score
        появляется меню если игроков много или ники длинные то next exit 
        непоявляется но нажать можно перейдет на след страничку
    + Feature request:
        Is there an option to display how many kills a person has on each level? Where when you spawn or kill someone it would say:

        You are on level 1 :: Glock 1/4 kills
        You are on level 1 :: Glock 2/4 kills

        etc for each level?
    * Bug report: gungame does not work with cssdm.
	    Native "SetFailState" reported: Signature CSSPlayer::CSWeaponDrop Failed. Please contact the author. 
    	2.1.1. CSSDM
    + Feature: maybe its possible to implement a very simple achievement system (for 
            example "Owner of the Day with x.xxx Kills" or "Killing Machine with 
            xxx Kills") which is set to zero every day, so you dont need a big database.
    + Feature: I have one more question. Is it possible to have few equip files (for 
        classic mode, reversed, random etc.) and change them by my own plugin?
        And what about changing GG cvar by plugin (some native for example)?
    * Bug report: Problem is that on nade level I get sometimes 2 flash nades. 
        I throw one and suddenly get another from nowhere. I'm not sure how to 
        reproduce it yet.

    ----====----==== High severity list ----====----====
    
    + Add winners menu:
        Also could you incorporate the attached code into your next release?
        The menu idea is from GG5's Winner Menu 
        (http://addons.eventscripts.com/addons/view/gg_winner_menu)
        https://forums.alliedmods.net/showpost.php?p=949442&postcount=255
        High severity because of much code to review and implement.
        
    ----====----==== Pending list ----====----====
    
    + Feature: create some options for gungame_stats like display rank to 
        all or to player only, show winner in chat etc.
        Pending because of i do not know what exactly features is needed.
    * Waiting for ability to check sourcemod version in runtime and use function that
        is not present in the previous versions. For example GetURandomInt was added
        in sm 1.3.0. So it is needed to recompile this plugin for versions less then 1.3.0
        without this function.
    
    ----====----==== Low priority list ----====----====
    
    + Feature: Implement !buylevel.
    * Improvement: Make removement buyzones on/off. So once gg is enabled than buyzones are
      disabled, and when gg is disabled buyzones are enabled.
      Maybe instead of removement buyzones just disable it to players on
      spawn and when gg swithces enabled/disabled.
    + Feature: Need features from es gg 5: Colorize knife-level player.
    + Feature: Need features from es gg 5: Random sounds?
