UTIL_Remove calls can be replaced in all games by AcceptEntityInput( index, "Kill" ).

GetSlot and RemoveAmmo should still work fine with new offsets.

There is a new native in SM for CSWeaponDrop, CS_DropWeapon, [url]http://docs.sourcemod.net/api/index.php?fastload=show&id=1013&[/url] It should work in both CS:S and CS:GO.

I'm not sure about EndMultiplayerGame. It might or might not work with new offset.
