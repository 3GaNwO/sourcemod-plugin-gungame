1+) UTIL_Remove calls can be replaced in all games by 
    AcceptEntityInput( index, "Kill" ).

2+-) GetSlot and RemoveAmmo should still work fine with new offsets.

3+) There is a new native in SM for CSWeaponDrop, CS_DropWeapon, 
    [url]http://docs.sourcemod.net/api/index.php?fastload=show&id=1013&[/url] 
    It should work in both CS:S and CS:GO.

4+) I'm not sure about EndMultiplayerGame. It might or might 
    not work with new offset.
